# Poetry-Revision
Here's the revised version of my poetry from earlier in the semester 

So I was kind of suprised when I opened this original code. I wasn't expecting that I really just used the template to create my poem so I decided to change it up in the revision. It's not much of a change and the idea is the same but I decided to make it my own story instead of using the same words from "A House Made of Glass". I decided to change the poem to "In a Land Of" so I could create some diffirent visuals that were more personal instead of something that was basically copy pasted. I added a couple more words to the poem as well as changing the genral idea, I did want to keep that ominous feeling to it though and I think it still stays in that realm.
